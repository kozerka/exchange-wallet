## Features

1. **Real-time Exchange Rates**: The application fetches real-time exchange rates from an external API, allowing users to see the current value of their transactions.
2. **Transaction Management**: Users can add new transactions, update existing ones, and safely delete them.
3. **Transaction History with Charts**: For each transaction, the application maintains a history of API queries, letting users track the value of their transactions over time. This history is visually represented using `react-charts`, providing an intuitive graphical representation of transaction values over time.
4. **Safe Deletion with Confirmation**: To prevent accidental deletions, the application provides a modal confirmation window when a user attempts to delete a transaction.
5. **Form Validation**: The application ensures that all input fields are correctly filled out before a transaction can be added or updated.
6. **Persistent Data with LocalStorage**: All transaction data is stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that user data remains intact even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.

## Configuration

### API Key Setup

ENV_SETUP.md included - with detailed info about API and configuration.

The application relies on an external API to fetch exchange rates. In short to set up the API:

1. Obtain an API key from the respective service provider.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
3. Add the API key to the `.env` file as follows:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Save the `.env` file. The application will now use this key to authenticate with the external service.



> **Note**: Always keep your API keys confidential. Do not expose them in the client-side code or public repositories.
